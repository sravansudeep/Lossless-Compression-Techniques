# Lossless Compression Techniques
## RLE (Run - Length - Encoding)

RLE or Run-Length Encoding is a simple and efficient compression technique that compresses sequences of repeated data by representing them as a single value (letter/bit) followed by the number of repetitions.

For example,
(`AAAAAABBBBBAAAAA`) -> (`A6B5A5`) or (`11110000011111`) -> (`140514`)
